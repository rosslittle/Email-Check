#Email Proxy

One of the problems our company has come across is that we constantly meet
people who offer web sites to generate leads but that they are only able
to supply those leads to us as emails rather than programatically through
web services or an API

This means we need to use a lot of human intervention in reading these
emails and inputting them into our CRM.  This is time wasted.

This set of scripts will read email from a given account and then
parse it given the rules that are assigned to it

This is the plan... achem...
